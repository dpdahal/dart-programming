## Introduction
- Dart is a client-optimized language for fast apps on any platform
- Dart is a language optimized for building mobile, desktop, server, and web applications
- Dart is a language created by Google
- Dart is an open-source language

## History
- Dart was unveiled at the GOTO conference in Aarhus, Denmark, October 10â€“12, 2011
- The goal of Dart is "ultimately to replace JavaScript as the lingua franca of web development on the open web platform"
- Dart was used for the first time in Google's AdWords platform in 2013

## Features
- Dart is an object-oriented, class defined language using a C-style syntax that transcompiles optionally into JavaScript
- It supports interfaces, mixins, abstract classes, reified generics, static typing, and a sound type system
- Dart helps you build modern web apps with a new language, core libraries, and tools
- Dart is focused on three main areas: strengthening and tightening the language, developing the Dart Web platform, and improving tooling support

## DartPad
- DartPad is an open-source tool that lets you play with the Dart language in any modern browser

## print() function
- The print() function is used to print the output to the console
- The print() function accepts a single argument and prints the string representation of the argument to the console

## Variables
- A variable is a container for storing data values
- Dart is a statically typed language, which means that the type of the variable is known at compile time
- Dart supports the following types of variables:

- Dart supports the following control flow statements:
  - if...else statement
  - switch...case statement
  - for loop
  - while loop
  - do...while loop
  - break statement
  - continue statement
  - assert statement

## Functions
- A function is a set of statements that performs a specific task
- Dart supports the following types of functions:
  - Named functions
  - Anonymous functions
  - Arrow functions
  - Recursive functions
  - Higher-order functions
  - Lambda functions

## Classes

- Dart supports the following types of classes:
  - Abstract classes
  - Concrete classes
  - Factory classes
  - Generative classes
  - Immutable classes
  - Mutable classes
  - Singleton classes

## Exception Handling
- Dart supports the following types of exception handling:
  - try...catch statement
  - on...catch statement
  - finally block
  - throw statement
  - rethrow statement

## Libraries
- Dart supports the following types of libraries:
  - Core libraries
  - Collection libraries
  - Math libraries
  - Async libraries
  - Convert libraries
  - Typed data libraries
  - HTML libraries
  - IO libraries
  - Isolate libraries
